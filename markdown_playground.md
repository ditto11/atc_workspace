## Choosing a race
This tutorial will cover only those races included in the Player's Handbook. However, additional playable races are listed in many auxiliary D&D sourcebooks, along with homebrew resources.

Those basic races are as follows:
* Dwarves
    * Bold and hardy, dwarves are known as skilled warriors, miners, and workers of stone and metal.
* Dragonborn
    * Dragonborn look very much like dragons standing erect in humanoid form, though they lack wings or a tail.
* Elves
    * Elves are a magical people of otherworldly grace, living in the world but not entirely part of it.
* Gnomes
    * A gnome’s energy and enthusiasm for living shines through every inch of their tiny body.
* Half-Elves
    * Half-elves combine what some say are the best qualities of their elf and human parents.
* Halflings
    * The diminutive halflings survive in a world full of larger creatures by avoiding notice or, barring that, avoiding offense.
* Half-Orc
    * Half-orcs’ grayish pigmentation, sloping foreheads, jutting jaws, prominent teeth, and towering builds make their orcish heritage plain for all to see.
* Humans
    * Humans are the most adaptable and ambitious people among the common races. Whatever drives them, humans are the innovators, the achievers, and the pioneers of the worlds.
* Tieflings
    * To be greeted with stares and whispers, to suffer violence and insult on the street, to see mistrust and fear in every eye: this is the lot of the tiefling.

In addition to determining your character's appearance, their race will have mechanical implications.
